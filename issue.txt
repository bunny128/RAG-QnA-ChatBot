‚ùå Issues in Your Code:
1. File Upload Handling Issue
Issue: You set accept_multiple_files=False but try to iterate over uploaded_files as if it's a list.
Fix: Change accept_multiple_files=True and properly iterate.
2. Missing Embedding Definition
Issue: embeddings is used in Chroma.from_documents() but is never defined.
Fix: Define embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings() before using it.
3. Temp File Overwriting
Issue: Temp file is named ./temp.pdf, which overwrites if multiple PDFs are uploaded.
Fix: Use a unique filename like ./temp_{uploaded_file.name}.
4. Misplaced Session History Handling
Issue: session_id is used before checking if it's in st.session_state.store.
Fix: Ensure session management is properly handled.
5. Incorrect API Call in conversational_rag_chain.invoke
Issue: Incorrect "configurablel" key spelling.
Fix: Change it to "configurable".
6. Incorrect st.success() Call
Issue: st.success('Assistant', response['answer']) is incorrect syntax.
Fix: It should be st.success(response['answer']).
7. Error Handling & Logging
Issue: No error handling if API keys are incorrect or LLM call fails.
Fix: Add try-except blocks.
